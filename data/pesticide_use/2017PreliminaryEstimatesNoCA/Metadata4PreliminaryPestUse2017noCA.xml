      <abstract>This dataset provides preliminary estimates of annual agricultural use of pesticide compounds in counties of the conterminous United States, except for California, for the year 2017, compiled by means of methods described in Thelin and Stone (2013) and Baker and Stone (2015). For all States except California, U.S. Department of Agriculture county-level data for harvested-crop acreage were used in conjunction with proprietary Crop Reporting District-level pesticide-use data to estimate county-level pesticide use. Where Crop Reporting District data were not available or were incomplete, estimated pesticide use values were calculated with two different methods, resulting in a low and a high estimate based on different assumptions about missing survey data (Thelin and Stone, 2013). 
	  
	  Preliminary estimates in this dataset are expected to be updated upon availability of California Department of Pesticide Regulation pesticide use reporting (DPR-PUR) 2017 database. At that time California estimates will be included in a revised 2017 dataset. In addition, preliminary estimates in this report are expected to be revised upon availability of updated crop acreages in the 2017 Agricultural Census, to be published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2019. Estimates of annual agricultural pesticide use are provided as downloadable, tab-delimited files, which are organized by compound, year, state Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, county FIPS code, and amount in kilograms (kg); (http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/index.php).
	  
	  Beginning 2015, the provider of the surveyed pesticide data used to derive the county-level use estimates discontinued making estimates for seed treatment application of pesticides because of complexity and uncertainty. Pesticide use estimates prior to 2015 include estimates with seed treatment application.</abstract>
      <purpose>Pesticide use estimates from this dataset were compiled for U.S. Geological Survey water-quality studies and are suitable for making national, regional, and watershed assessments of annual pesticide use.</purpose>
      <supplinf>For all states except California, pesticide-use data were obtained from proprietary surveys of farm operations within U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Reporting Districts (CRDs). CRDs represent a collection of contiguous counties within a State.  The survey data are based on agricultural pesticide use surveys of farm operations distributed throughout the conterminous United States (Baker and Stone, 2015; Kynetec, AgroTrak, written commun., 2017). These were used to calculate pesticide per crop acre, or an 'estimated pesticide use' (EPest) rate, for each pesticide compound used in a CRD. County-use estimates were then calculated by multiplying EPest rates by harvested-crop acres for each pesticide-by-crop combination in each county with annual harvested-crop acres reported by the USDA 2012 Census of Agriculture (Ag Census) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014) and USDA National Agricultural Statistics (NASS) 2017 County Agricultural Production Survey (CAPS) (U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2018) for each crop harvested in the CRD for 2017. The methods documented in this report summarize the more detailed methods developed and described by Thelin and Stone (2013) and updated by Baker and Stone (2015). 
	  
	  Two different estimates, EPest-low and EPest-high, provide a range of pesticide-use rates (Thelin and Stone, 2013 and Baker and Stone, 2015) where a pesticide-use rate is not available for a crop from a CRD. Both methods incorporated surveyed and extrapolated rates to estimate pesticide use for counties, but EPest-low and EPest-high estimation procedures differed in how they treated situations in which a CRD was surveyed and pesticide use was not reported (missing) for a particular pesticide-by-crop combination. The EPest-low estimate is assigned a null value (blank) when there is not enough information to determine whether use occurred but was not captured by the survey or whether use did not occur for that pesticide and crop. EPest-high, however, treats missing data for surveyed CRDs as pesticide use likely to occur and therefore calculates a use rate from neighboring CRDs or CRDs within the same region to estimate the pesticide-by-crop use. This method is described in detail by Thelin and Stone (2013). The EPest-high estimate is based generally on the median of reported pesticide-by-crop use rates from surveyed farmers in neighboring CRDs and, in some cases, CRDs within the same USDA Farm Resource Region (Thelin and Stone, 2013). EPest-low annual-use totals can be greater than EPest-high totals when the low method of estimation concentrates the use to a particular geographic area while the high method spreads the use over a larger geographic area. There is uncertainty in both the high and low estimates that is difficult to quantify. A user should become familiar with the two methods to decide which estimate is best for a specific application.   
	  
	  County annual harvested-crop acres reported in the 2012 Ag Census (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014) and 2017 CAPS (U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2018) were used in this compilation. The Ag Census is the most uniform and complete source of crop-acre estimates for all counties in the United States. The Ag Census is published every 5th year, with CAPS reporting crop-acre estimates for selected crops and counties for interim Ag Census years. For the 1992–2009 pesticide-use estimates (Stone, 2013) and 2008–2012 estimates (Baker and Stone, 2015), acreages for crops not surveyed by CAPS were interpolated linearly between census years. By convention, estimates of county acreages made for years before an Ag Census is available and where CAPS data are unavailable carry forward acreages from the most recent published Ag Census (Stone, 2013; Baker and Stone, 2013). Thus, the 2017 estimates published herein use 2012 Ag Census acreages in counties where CAPS acreages are not available for 2017. When the 2017 Ag Census data are published in 2019, annual estimates for 2013 through 2017 are expected to be revised by using linear interpolation between 2012 and 2017 for crop acreages not reported by CAPS.
