A monitoring violation occurs when a public water system owner does not collect a required sample.  A reporting violation occurs when a public water system owner does not report the result(s) to the state from a sample that was collected.  When a public water system's owner does not collect a required sample, the violation is often referred to as a monitoring and reporting violation.
