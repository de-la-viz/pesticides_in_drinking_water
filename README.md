# Pesticides in Drinking Water

A try at predicting violations of drinking water in New England's water systems. In addition, I also try to predict the violations of maximum contaminant levels in New England's water systems by pesticides.  

**The procedure and results of this analysis are summarized in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_BFCSApEwgKDsnK_6E4I5ZDO8wfYpLv-QmWbZlTdxt4/edit?usp=sharing).**





## Data Extraction

The data is coming from SDWIS, all the extraction is described in [this notebook](https://github.com/de-la-viz/pesticides_in_drinking_water/blob/master/code/Data_Extraction.ipynb).

Pesticide use estimates are downloaded from the National Water-Quality Assessment ([NAWQA](https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/county-level/)) Project.

## Data Processing and Feature Engineering

Data processing is done and explained in [this notebook](https://github.com/de-la-viz/pesticides_in_drinking_water/blob/master/code/Data_Processing_and_Feature_Engineering.ipynb).

## Classification

The classification and prediction is done in [this notebook](https://github.com/de-la-viz/pesticides_in_drinking_water/blob/master/code/Classification.ipynb).
