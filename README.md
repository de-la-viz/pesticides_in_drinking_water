# Pesticides in Drinking Water

A try at predicting violations of drinking water in New England's water systems. In addition, I also try to predict the violations of maximum contaminant levels in New England's water systems by pesticides.  

The procedure and results of this analysis are summarized in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_BFCSApEwgKDsnK_6E4I5ZDO8wfYpLv-QmWbZlTdxt4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Data

The data is coming from SDWIS, all the extraction is described in [this notebook](https://github.com/de-la-viz/pesticides_in_drinking_water/blob/master/code/Data_Extraction.ipynb).

Estimates of pesticides used are downloaded from the National Water-Quality Assessment ([NAWQA](https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/county-level/)) Project

## Feature Selection and Engineering

Data processing is done and explained in [this notebook](https://github.com/de-la-viz/pesticides_in_drinking_water/blob/master/code/Data_Processing_and_Feature_Engineering.ipynb)

## Classification

The classification and prediction is done is done in [this notebook](https://github.com/de-la-viz/pesticides_in_drinking_water/blob/master/code/Classification.ipynb)
